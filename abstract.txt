Abstract:
Large scale storage infrastructures have been significantly impacted by the
growth in data analytics applications. High Performance Computing storage
infrastructures, once the extreme end of the storage scale spectrum, must now
adapt to technologies optimized for large scale data analytics applications.
Hardware changes, such as storage class memory, are also affecting how
the exascale storage stack will be constructed. We examine use cases, trends,
convergent technologies, and new opportunities generated by this technology
blending.
