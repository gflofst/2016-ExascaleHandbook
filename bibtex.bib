abstract = {We describe the implementation of a flexible data storage system for the UNIX environment that has been designed as an experimental vehicle for building database management systems. The storage component forms a foundation upon which a variety of database systems can be constructed including support for unconventional types of data. We describe the system architecture, the design decisions incorporated within its implementation, our experiences in developing this large piece of software, and the applications that have been built on top of it.},

@inproceedings{welch:2008:panasas,
        Abstract = {The Panasas file system uses parallel and redundant access to object storage devices (OSDs), per-file RAID, distributed metadata management, consistent client caching, file locking services, and internal cluster management to provide a scalable, fault tolerant, high performance distributed file system. The clustered design of the storage system and the use of client-driven RAID provide scalable performance to many concurrent file system clients through parallel access to file data that is striped across OSD storage nodes. RAID recovery is performed in parallel by the cluster of metadata managers, and declustered data placement yields scalable RAID rebuild rates as the storage system grows larger. This paper presents performance measures of I/O, metadata, and recovery operations for storage clusters that range in size from 10 to 120 storage nodes, 1 to 12 metadata nodes, and with file system client counts ranging from 1 to 100 compute nodes. Production installations are as large as 500 storage nodes, 50 metadata managers, and 5000 clients.},

@inproceedings{schmuck:2002:gpfs,
        Abstract = {GPFS is IBM's parallel, shared-disk file system for cluster computers,
        available on the RS/6000 SP parallel supercomputer and on Linux clusters.
        GPFS is used on many of the largest supercomputers in the world.
        GPFS was built on many of the ideas that were developed in the academic
        community over the last several years, particularly distributed locking
        and recovery technology. To date it has been a matter of conjecture
        how well these ideas scale. We have had the opportunity to test those
        limits in the context of a product that runs on the largest systems
        in existence. While in many cases existing ideas scaled well, new
        approaches were necessary in many key areas. This paper describes
        GPFS, and discusses how distributed locking and recovery techniques
        were extended to scale to large clusters. },
